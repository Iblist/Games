Compiling: Simply type make, a binary will be created in the bin file.  Type ./bin/runMe to execute the file.

Ussage:  The game is pretty simple; hit random keys and stuff appears on the screen.  To quit the game, hit esc.

Bugs:  I haven't handed this to any babies yet, so who knows.  I don't plan on trying that any time either, I like this computer.
