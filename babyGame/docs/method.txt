1: Get user Input, and translate resulting character into an ascii value.

2: Use ascii value to choose yx coordinate on screen.  Essentially, we will use a sin function for now multiplied by 10.  The maximum value possible is 1,
   Therfore The maximum value will be 10 and a minimum of 0.  The screen size must be at least 127 x units wide.  Add 20 to the new value to center the 
   Colours better.

3: Move cursor to selected part of the screen.  If the selected area's colour is black, it should be made white, if the area is white, it should be made black.
   The spaces above, below, and beside this space should also have their colours swapped.  The trick here is to draw a character to determine color.  Foreground and
   Background will be the same, "W" will mean white and "B" will mean black.

4: Game should continue playing until ESC is hit. (ESC is 27 in the ascii table.)
